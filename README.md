# automatic-authentication-with-Google
Hello everyone, hope you're doing well, I'm developing my web application on lovable. In fact, I can't configure automatic authentication with Google properly, the Lovable AI has suggested a lot of things (supabase configuration, google cloud configuration) but nothing works, you can see the error message i get in the attachments.
